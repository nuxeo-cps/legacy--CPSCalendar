Requires:

- Private events are now shown only as black/gray space with no links for
  other users.
- There is now a setting on the portal_cpscalendar to select if events 
  should have fulltext indexing or not.
- Events now have a link to select a document related to the event.
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Permission problems when validating fixed by using unrestrictedtraverse.
- iCalendar export did not support recurring events
- iCalendar export used TZID to specify timezope, without specifying a VTIMEZONE
  part. This is false according to the RFC2445 which states "An individual
  'VTIMEZONE' calendar component MUST be specified for each unique 'TZID'
  parameter value specified in the iCalendar object." 
  Dates are now always specified in UTC instead.
