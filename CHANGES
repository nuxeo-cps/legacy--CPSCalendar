New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- A new setting in the portal_cpscalendar tool decides if user searches in the
  personal calendars should be limited to user with a View permission. This is
  default to off, but should be set to on if you have very large or slow 
  directories. Setting it to on requires every user to give a View permission
  to any users they want to able to invite to events created in their
  personal calendar.
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- The Directory search for users is now limited to only include those users
  who have the View permission on the calendar, to speed up the search with
  large LDAP directories.
- An intermittent session problem which caused the attendees to be dropped
  when creating a meeting was maybe fixed. (As it is intermittent, it's hard
  to be sure).
