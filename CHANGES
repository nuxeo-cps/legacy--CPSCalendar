ZODB Requires:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Remove all your calendars and restart from start.

New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- You can now have many calendars (but "your" calendar is the one with id
  'calendar'.

New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- calendars are now identified by their 'rpath' (relative path to the portal)
  rather than id. So many method calls and datastructures use now 'rpath'
  argument or field instead of 'id'.

  For calendar tool:
    - renamed getCalendarObjects -> listCalendars
    - renamed getCalendarIds -> listCalendarPaths
