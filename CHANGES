- Fixed the display of multiple calendars. (bugzilla #259)
- Fixed the adding of events with end before start. (bugzilla #261)
- Some events seemed to be displayed in incorrect dates (in fact it was the
  adding that gave it weird start and end-dates). (bugzilla #334)
- There was some bugs in the Meeting helper pages which prompted a

  calendar week display.
