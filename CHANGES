Bug fixes:

- Now adds a "null_wf" that only has a create state, for objects that should 
  not have any workflow actions, in this case calendars and events. 
  This removes the "Checkout version" and "submit links" on events and the
  "New" link on calendars.(Bug #978).
- The organizer is now displayed with the full name for new events.
  This solves bug #908.
