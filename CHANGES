New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The mail notification now also sends mail to unconfirmed attendees.
- The notify mail is now translatable.
- There is now a new function stringToDateTime() that parses date strings
  intelligently, both according to what is possible, and with regards to
  the locale you have (i.e, selected language). The utilisation of this
  solves Mantis bug #652.
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- It was impossible to change the event type after creation.
- The montly display for was incorrect if the viewed day was in the end
  of march.
- February could be skippad completely when navigating in monthly view,
  in really unlucky cases. Rewrote that part, with a new skin method,
  calendar_getPrevNextPage.py.
- Trying to get an email for orphaned members raises a key error.
  I now trap this.
- Headers in the notification mails was calculated twice.
- The attendees search box now uses the member_search laout widgets,
  instead of the member layout, thus only showing searchable fields.
- There were two lingering references to the all_day attribute that
  had not been changed (Mantis #653).
- The meeting helper form did not display leading zeroes on minutes.
