BUGS:
- Earlier, if start was later then end, a page for asking if the event 
  should be extended popped up. That is completely unintuitive and strange.
  If you want to create a multi-day event, you select that. Multi-day events
  do not have hours. 
  
  Change that page to "Should the times be switched" and make it work,
  or simply just switch the times. You can edit it afterwards.

P1:


P2: 


P3:
- create a management screen for Calendar (Title, and other things)

- smarter notifications

- show today with a different color

- add an interface to filter what canceled and declined events we really
  want to delete

- add history to events (even to deleted events...)

- add an interface to send freeform mails to attendees and/or organizer

- add interface and code for import

- add WebDav interface for global import


Cleanup / refactoring:

- suppress "string:en" in the forms. (Why? /Lennart)
