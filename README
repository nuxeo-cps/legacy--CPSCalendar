Introduction
--------------------------------------------------

CPSCalendar provides events managment, using calendars and events. Each user
has access to its own personal calendar, and other calendars can be created in
workspaces anywhere on the site.

It is possible to create different sorts of events (private or public, confirmed
or not,...), to specify attendees to an event, to superpose calendars,...

See the 'Features' section below for more information.

Features
--------------------------------------------------

Calendars
---------

Each user has access to its own personal calendar.

Users can navigate through calendars by day, week and month. Each view gives
access to a printable view. There is also a summary view of all the events of
the week.

It is possible to check when other users are available, using the shared
calendars facility.

It is also possible to add calendars in workspaces, and allow several users
to add events to it.

CPSCalendar provides an export feature using the iCalendar format. Other
applications supporting this format will be able to import the exported events.


Events
------

An event is defined using the following parameters:

- Title

- Event type:

  o standard: specify a day, a starting hour and an ending hour.
  o all day: specify a starting day and an ending day.
  o recurring: specify the recurrency type, a starting day and hour, and an
    ending day and hour.

- Date: the date(s) and hour(s) to specify could chnage according to the event
  type described above.

- Location

- Status:

  o Unconfirmed: the user has not confirmed his/her participation to the event.
  o Confirmed: the user has confirmed his/her participation to the event.
  o Canceled:  the user has canceled his/her participation to the event.

  The status is used for the system to decide if the user is available for
  other events.

- Category:

  o Work: the event will be visible to other users.
  o Private: the subject of the event will not be visible to other users, but
    they will see that the user has plans for this period of time.

- Transparent:

  If the event is transparent, it means that the user is not busy during this
  event, e.g. that this event is not very important :)
  This option is used for the system to decide if the user is available for
  other events.

- Description: for complementary information.


When an event has been created, it is possible to add attendees to it.
Attendees are users of the site, and can confirm/unconfirm/cancel their
participation to the event. They are notified when changes are made to the
event.


Meetings
--------

A meeting is an event.
When adding a meeting, you have access to a search interface that allows you to
specify attendees to the meeting, and chose a date for your event more easily:
their personal calendars are checked to see when they are available.


--------------------------------------------------
Roles and permissions
--------------------------------------------------

Here is the mapping between roles and permissions on a calendar:
- A manager of the calendar will be able to:
  o view events
  o edit events
  o create events
  o delete events
  o manage events (XXX what does it mean ???)
- A member of the calendar will be able to:
  o view events
  o edit events
  o create events
- A reader of the calendar will be able to:
  o view events

Calendars (and events) inherit the roles and permissions set on their folder
container:
- a workspace manager will be manager of the calendar.
- a workspace member will be member of the calendar.
- a workspace reader will be reader of the calendar.

These roles can be set manually on a given calendar, by assigning local roles to
users directly on it, as on any workspace.
