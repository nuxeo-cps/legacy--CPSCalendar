Using the Module
================

CPSCalendar supports posting and managing events.  Each user has a
personal calendar, and a calendar can also be created in other
workspaces.

The README file in the product gives a concise description of the
capabilities, as well as explaining how to use the module.


History of the Module
=====================

CPSCalendar has been re-implemented, and now only runs with CPS3.
The calendars and events created with a version of the product
earlier than version 1.2.0 are not compatible with versions 1.2.0
and later.  In subsequent versions, the installation script
supports data migration from older instances.


Prerequisites for the Use of the Module
=======================================

CPSCalendar requires:

- CPS3 (3.0 or later)

- CPSInstaller (which is included with CPS-3.1 and later)

- CPSNavigation 0.8.0 or later, which is also included with more
  recent versions of CPS.  It is required after version 1.6.4 of
  CPSCalendar.  It is also available at http://svn.nuxeo.org/.

CPSCalendar has been tested with Zope 2.6 and Zope 2.7.


Installation
============

If CPSCalendar was not included in your version of CPS, place the
CPSCalendar product in the Products directory of your Zope
instance.  Either down-load it and uncompress it, *or* down-load
it with Subversion (see: http://svn.nuxeo.org/).

The INSTALL file in the CPSCalendar product contains instructions
on how to install CPSCalendar in an instance of CPS.  It also
gives information on how to bring your site up-to-date if an
earlier version of CPSCalendar, requiring data migration, had been
installed in your CPS site.
