CPSCalendar Installation
--------------------------------------------------

$Id$

--------------------------------------------------
Requirements
--------------------------------------------------

CPSCalendar requires:
- CPS3 (3.0 or higher)
- product CPSInstaller (not included in CPS-3.0, but included in CPS-3.1)
- product CPSNavigation > 0.8.0 (not included in CPS 3)

It's been tested with Zope 2.6 and Zope 2.7.

--------------------------------------------------
Installation notes
--------------------------------------------------

- Unpack the distribution into the Products folder of your Zope installation
  and change its name 'CPSCalendar-X.X.X-X' to 'CPSCalendar'

- Restart Zope. Check in Control_Panel/Products that there is a CPSCalendar
  product and that there were no import errors.

- From the ZMI, go to the CPS root, instantiate an External Method with the
  following parameters:
  ID = any Id you want, like cpscalendar_install
  Title = anything you want, like CPSCalendar Installer
  Module Name = CPSCalendar.install
  Function Name = install

- After creation, open the External Method object and click the "Test" tab to
  run it.

- CPSCalendar should now be installed.

Update notes
--------------------------------------------------

If your previous version of CPSCalendar was prior to version 1.2.0, compatibily
is broken: you have to remove all your calendars and restart with new ones.

If your previous version of CPSCalendar was prior to version 1.6.2, you have to
rerun the install method, as it upgrades event objects.
